- How are you checking if the user is new(first time) or existing user?
- How are we validating zones while fetching gps coordinates? Are we just cross-checking which zone user falls under or also cheking region?




Improvements:
1. If the user is first time then what is the ui flow?
2. If the user has signed out or there is a session time out due to app inactivity and later opens the app again. Then what is the flow?
3. Have we implemented any inactive app session? If app is not opened or used for several days then is there a app timeout feature implemented?
4. 

GPS OFF:

- Scenario 1: App opens -> splash screen -> location access -> Home screen
- Scenario 2(new user : New device) - App opens -> onboarding screens -> authentication page -> splash screen -> location access -> Home screen
- Scenario 3(Existing user :New device) - App opens -> onboarding screens -> authentication page -> splash screen -> location access -> Home screen
- Scenario 4(Logged out/inactive session/timeout) : App opens -> authentication screen -> splash screen -> location access -> Home screen
