2. Architecture and code quality
3. Backend/database integration status
4. Pending implementations and blockers
5. Areas requiring immediate attention

---

### **📊 Key Findings**

#### **✅ Strengths Identified**

1. **Solid Foundation Architecture**
   - Clean architecture principles properly implemented
   - Proper separation of concerns (presentation, data, core layers)
   - Dependency injection with GetIt service locator
   - Riverpod for state management with proper provider structure

2. **Robust Backend Integration**
   - Supabase properly configured with environment variables
   - AuthService successfully connects to database
   - Agent authentication works against `agents` table
   - Application submissions properly stored in `pending_agents` table
   - Error handling implemented for database operations

3. **Shared Package Architecture**
   - `shared_types`: Well-defined AgentModel with proper enums
   - `ui_components`: Reusable DaylizButton, DaylizTextField, LoadingWidget
   - `business_logic`: AuthService and OrderService properly exported
   - Proper package dependencies and versioning

4. **UI/UX Implementation**
   - Professional auth flow with landing, login, and registration screens
   - Consistent design language using Dayliz brand colors
   - Proper form validation and error display
   - Loading states and user feedback implemented

#### **⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention**

1. **Auth Flow Cleanup Needed**
   - "New to Dayliz" section still present in agent login screen (lines 284-309)
   - "Apply to Join as Agent" button in auth landing screen is functional (needs disabling)
   - Registration form is complex multi-step (user wants single-page)

2. **Mock Data Usage**
   - Dashboard displays hardcoded mock orders instead of real data
   - No real-time order assignment functionality
   - Agent status management not implemented

3. **Incomplete Features**
   - Order management is placeholder implementation
   - Earnings tracking not connected to real data
   - Profile management is basic structure only
   - No push notifications or real-time updates

#### **🔗 Database Integration Status**

**✅ Working Integrations:**
- Agent authentication via Supabase Auth
- Application submission to `pending_agents` table
- Agent data retrieval from `agents` table
- Proper error handling and exception management

**❌ Missing Integrations:**
- Real-time order assignment and updates
- Agent status management (online/offline)
- Earnings calculation and tracking
- Order status updates (accept, pickup, deliver)

#### **📱 Screen Implementation Status**

| Screen | Status | Functionality | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Auth Landing | ✅ Complete | Entry point with two actions | Needs button disabling |
| Agent Login | ✅ Complete | Email/phone + password auth | Needs cleanup |
| Registration | ⚠️ Needs Rework | Multi-step form | Convert to single-page |
| Dashboard | ⚠️ Basic | Mock data display | Needs real data integration |
| Orders | ❌ Placeholder | No real functionality | Requires implementation |
| Profile | ❌ Basic | Minimal structure | Needs enhancement |
| Earnings | ❌ Placeholder | No real data | Requires implementation |
