# Database Schema Alignment - Completed

## Overview

This document outlines the completed database schema alignment for the Dayliz App. The alignment ensures that the Supabase database schema matches the domain entities defined in the clean architecture implementation.

## Alignment Status

| Entity | Database Table | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| UserProfile | user_profiles | ✅ Completed | Added last_updated and profile_image_url columns |
| Address | addresses | ✅ Completed | Added address_type, landmark, and recipient_name columns |
| Product | products | ✅ Completed | Added discount_percentage, main_image_url, and attributes columns |
| Category | categories | ✅ Completed | Added slug and display_order columns |
| SubCategory | subcategories | ✅ Completed | Added display_order and product_count columns |
| PaymentMethod | payment_methods | ✅ Completed | Created new table with name and details columns |
| Order | orders | ✅ Completed | Added subtotal, tax, shipping, and other columns |
| OrderItem | order_items | ✅ Completed | Added product_name, image_url, and options columns |
| CartItem | cart_items | ✅ Completed | Added added_at, selected, and saved_for_later columns |
| WishlistItem | wishlist_items | ✅ Completed | Created new table for wishlist functionality |
| Notification | notifications | ✅ Completed | Created new table for notification functionality |

## Alignment Process

The database schema alignment was completed in several phases:

### 1. Schema Analysis

We analyzed the existing database schema and compared it with the domain entities defined in the clean architecture implementation. This analysis identified gaps and inconsistencies that needed to be addressed.

### 2. Schema Updates

We created migration scripts to update the database schema:

- Added missing columns to existing tables
- Created new tables for entities that didn't have corresponding tables
- Updated data types and constraints to match domain entities
- Added foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity
- Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables

### 3. Data Migration

We migrated existing data to match the new schema:

- Converted legacy payment method data to the new format
- Created coordinates JSON from latitude and longitude in addresses
- Set default values for required fields
- Migrated data between columns where needed

### 4. Performance Optimization

We implemented performance optimizations to improve database performance:

- Created indexes for common queries
- Implemented materialized views for reporting
- Added database functions for complex operations
- Implemented full-text search for products
- Added geospatial query support for addresses
- Created a real-time notification system

## Key Improvements

### 1. Entity-Database Mapping

We created a comprehensive mapping between domain entities and database tables, ensuring that all entity properties have corresponding database columns with appropriate data types and constraints.

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS)

We enabled Row Level Security on all tables and created policies to ensure that users can only access their own data. This improves security and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### 3. Performance Optimizations

We implemented various performance optimizations to improve database performance:

- **Indexing Strategy**: Created indexes for common queries to improve performance
- **Materialized Views**: Created materialized views for common reports to reduce query complexity
- **Database Functions**: Added functions for complex operations to reduce data transfer
- **Full-Text Search**: Implemented full-text search for products to improve search relevance
- **Geospatial Queries**: Added geospatial query support for location-based features
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Created a notification system for order status changes

### 4. Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation to support the database schema alignment:

- **Entity-Database Mapping**: Detailed mapping between domain entities and database tables
- **Migration Plan**: Plan for migrating the database schema with detailed steps
- **Performance Optimization Summary**: Overview of performance optimizations
- **Usage Guide**: Guide for using the database features in clean architecture

## Migration Details

The database schema alignment was completed through a series of migrations:

1. **Schema Alignment (Versions 1.1.0 - 1.6.0)**
   - Updated tables to match domain entities
   - Added missing columns and tables
   - Created indexes and constraints
   - Enabled Row Level Security

2. **Data Migration (Versions 2.0.1 - 2.6.0)**
   - Migrated data to match the new schema
   - Set default values for required fields
   - Validated data integrity

3. **Performance Optimization (Versions 3.1.0 - 3.8.0)**
   - Created indexes for common queries
   - Implemented materialized views
   - Added database functions
   - Implemented full-text search
   - Added geospatial query support
   - Created a real-time notification system

## Next Steps

With the database schema alignment completed, the next steps are:

1. **Repository Implementation**
   - Update repository implementations to use the new database features
   - Implement error handling for database operations
   - Add validation for input data

2. **Testing**
   - Create unit tests for repository implementations
   - Implement integration tests for database operations
   - Add end-to-end tests for the entire application

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation to reflect the new database schema
   - Create examples for using the database features
   - Document best practices for database operations

## Conclusion

The database schema alignment has been successfully completed, providing a solid foundation for the clean architecture implementation. The alignment ensures that the database schema matches the domain entities, enabling the repository pattern to work effectively.

The performance optimizations implemented during the alignment process will improve database performance and enable advanced features like full-text search, geospatial queries, and real-time notifications.

This alignment is a critical milestone in the clean architecture migration, as it enables the data layer to correctly support the domain layer, making the code more maintainable and testable.
