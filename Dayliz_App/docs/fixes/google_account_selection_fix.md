# Google Account Selection Fix
*Implemented: December 2024*

## üéØ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

After signing out and attempting to sign in/sign up with Google again, users were not presented with the account selection dialog. Instead, Google Sign-In would automatically use the previously signed-in account, preventing users from switching to different Google accounts.

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The issue was caused by Google Sign-In caching the last authenticated account. When users signed out from the Dayliz app, the Google Sign-In session remained active, causing subsequent sign-in attempts to skip the account picker and automatically use the cached account.

### **Technical Details:**
- Google Sign-In maintains its own session state separate from Supabase
- `googleSignIn.signOut()` was not being called during app logout
- Subsequent `googleSignIn.signIn()` calls would use the cached account
- No mechanism to force account selection on new sign-in attempts

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Enhanced GoogleSignInService**

#### **Added Force Account Selection Parameter**
```dart
Future<AuthResponse?> signInWithGoogle({bool forceAccountSelection = true})
Future<String?> getGoogleAuthToken({bool forceAccountSelection = true})
```

#### **Added Complete Logout Method**
```dart
Future<void> completeLogout() async {
  // Signs out from both Supabase and Google
  await _supabaseClient.auth.signOut();
  await _googleSignIn.signOut();
}
```

#### **Added Force Account Selection Method**
```dart
Future<void> forceAccountSelection() async {
  await _googleSignIn.signOut();
}
```

### **2. Updated Authentication Flow**

#### **Sign-In Process Enhancement**
- Before each Google Sign-In attempt, the service now calls `_googleSignIn.signOut()`
- This clears the cached Google account and forces the account picker to appear
- Users can now select any Google account for authentication

#### **Logout Process Enhancement**
- Updated `AuthSupabaseDataSource.logout()` to use `GoogleSignInService.completeLogout()`
- Ensures both Supabase and Google sessions are properly cleared
- Guarantees account selection on next sign-in attempt

### **3. Implementation Details**

#### **GoogleSignInService Changes:**
```dart
// BEFORE: Direct sign-in without clearing cache
final googleUser = await _googleSignIn.signIn();

// AFTER: Force account selection by clearing cache first
if (forceAccountSelection) {
  await _googleSignIn.signOut();
}
final googleUser = await _googleSignIn.signIn();
```

#### **Data Source Changes:**
```dart
// BEFORE: Only Supabase logout
await _supabaseClient.auth.signOut();

// AFTER: Complete logout from both services
final googleSignInService = GoogleSignInService.instance;
await googleSignInService.completeLogout();
```

## üß™ **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Test Case 1: Account Switching**
1. ‚úÖ Sign in with Google Account A
2. ‚úÖ Sign out from app
3. ‚úÖ Click Google Sign-In button
4. ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Account picker appears
5. ‚úÖ Select Google Account B
6. ‚úÖ **RESULT**: Successfully signs in with Account B

### **Test Case 2: Same Account Re-selection**
1. ‚úÖ Sign in with Google Account A
2. ‚úÖ Sign out from app
3. ‚úÖ Click Google Sign-In button
4. ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Account picker appears
5. ‚úÖ Select same Google Account A
6. ‚úÖ **RESULT**: Successfully signs in with Account A

### **Test Case 3: Registration Flow**
1. ‚úÖ Navigate to registration screen
2. ‚úÖ Click Google Sign-Up button
3. ‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Account picker appears
4. ‚úÖ Select any Google account
5. ‚úÖ **RESULT**: Successfully creates account and signs in

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Files Modified:**
1. `lib/core/services/google_sign_in_service.dart`
   - Added `forceAccountSelection` parameter to sign-in methods
   - Added `completeLogout()` method
   - Added `forceAccountSelection()` method

2. `lib/data/datasources/auth_supabase_data_source_new.dart`
   - Updated `logout()` to use `GoogleSignInService.completeLogout()`
   - Added fallback mechanism for Google logout failures

### **Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing code continues to work unchanged
- New `forceAccountSelection` parameter defaults to `true`
- Fallback mechanisms ensure robustness

## üìä **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **User Experience Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Account Flexibility**: Users can easily switch between Google accounts
- ‚úÖ **Intuitive Behavior**: Account picker appears as expected
- ‚úÖ **Consistent UX**: Same behavior across login and registration screens
- ‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved

### **Security Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Session Isolation**: Proper session cleanup prevents account confusion
- ‚úÖ **Explicit Choice**: Users explicitly choose which account to use
- ‚úÖ **Privacy Protection**: Previous account data doesn't leak to new sessions

### **Technical Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Clean State Management**: Proper cleanup of authentication state
- ‚úÖ **Robust Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- ‚úÖ **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns

## üéØ **VERIFICATION STEPS**

### **For Developers:**
1. Run the app and sign in with Google Account A
2. Sign out from the app
3. Attempt to sign in with Google again
4. **Verify**: Account picker dialog appears
5. Select a different Google account
6. **Verify**: Sign-in succeeds with the selected account

### **For QA Testing:**
1. Test with multiple Google accounts
2. Test account switching scenarios
3. Test both login and registration flows
4. Verify proper session cleanup
5. Test edge cases (network issues, cancelled sign-ins)

## ‚úÖ **CONCLUSION**

The Google Account Selection fix has been successfully implemented and tested. Users can now:

- **Switch between Google accounts** seamlessly
- **See the account picker** on every sign-in attempt
- **Have full control** over which Google account to use
- **Experience consistent behavior** across all authentication flows

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience for Google Sign-In functionality.

**Status: PRODUCTION READY** üöÄ
