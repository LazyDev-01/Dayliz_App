## 📝 Notes for Phase 2

As we move into Phase 2, we should consider the following observations from Phase 1:

1. **Image Loading Issues**
   - There are some issues with loading images from Unsplash URLs that should be addressed in Phase 2
   - Consider using local assets or a more reliable image service for product images

2. **UI Overflow Issues**
   - Minor layout overflow issues were observed in some components
   - These should be addressed as part of the UI polish in Phase 2

3. **Database Schema Adjustments**
   - The product model in Supabase doesn't exactly match our model class (missing additional_images column)
   - Need to either update the database schema or adjust the model to match the database

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2

With all essential components of Phase 1 completed, the project is ready to move to Phase 2: Product Browsing + UI Polish. The foundation has been established, providing a solid base for implementing the more user-facing features in the next phase.
