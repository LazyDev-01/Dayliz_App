# Clean Architecture Activation

## Overview

This document outlines the process of activating the clean architecture screens (home, categories, product) as the primary and default ones in the Dayliz App, while disabling the legacy screens.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Main Navigation Routes**:
   - Redirected `/home` to `/clean-home` (CleanMainScreen)
   - Redirected `/categories` to `/clean/categories`
   - Redirected `/cart` to `/clean/cart`
   - Redirected `/checkout` to `/clean/checkout`
   - Redirected `/product/:id` to `/clean/product/:id`
   - Redirected `/category/:id` to `/clean/category/:id`

2. **Updated CleanMainScreen**:
   - Replaced placeholder screens with actual clean architecture implementations:
     - CleanHomeScreen
     - CleanCategoriesScreen
     - CleanCartScreen
     - CleanOrderListScreen
   - Removed unused _PlaceholderScreen class

3. **Updated Authentication Redirect Logic**:
   - Changed redirect for authenticated users from `/home` to `/clean-home`

4. **Ensured Bottom Navigation Works with Clean Architecture**:
   - Confirmed that CommonBottomNavBar navigates to clean architecture routes

## Benefits

1. **Consistent User Experience**:
   - Users now experience the clean architecture implementation by default
   - Modern UI components and improved performance

2. **Simplified Codebase**:
   - Reduced duplication by using a single implementation for each screen type
   - Clearer navigation flow

3. **Better Maintainability**:
   - All active screens follow clean architecture principles
   - Easier to add new features and fix bugs

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Migration**:
   - Continue removing legacy screens one by one
   - Focus on home screen or cart screen as next candidates for removal
   - Implement missing screens (email verification, password reset, etc.)

2. **Database Schema Alignment**:
   - Complete analysis of existing Supabase schema vs. clean architecture entities
   - Create migration scripts to align database with entity models
   - Update column names to match code conventions
   - Add missing tables and relationships

3. **Testing**:
   - Implement systematic testing for completed features
   - Focus on unit tests for use cases and repositories
   - Add widget tests for critical UI components
   - Perform integration testing between features

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile the app to identify any performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize rendering and state management
   - Improve error handling and loading states in clean architecture screens
