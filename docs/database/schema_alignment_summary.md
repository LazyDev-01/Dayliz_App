# Database Schema Alignment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to align the Supabase database schema with the clean architecture domain entities. The goal was to ensure that the database schema supports the domain entities and use cases defined in the clean architecture implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Alignment

We've updated the database schema to align with the following domain entities:

- **Address**: Updated the `addresses` table to include fields like `address_type`, `landmark`, and `recipient_name`.
- **UserProfile**: Ensured the `user_profiles` table has the necessary constraints and relationships.
- **Product**: Enhanced the `products` table with fields like `discount_percentage`, `main_image_url`, and `attributes`.
- **PaymentMethod**: Created a new `payment_methods` table to store user payment methods.
- **Order & OrderItem**: Updated the `orders` and `order_items` tables to match the domain entities.
- **CartItem**: Updated the `cart_items` table with fields like `added_at` and `saved_for_later`.
- **WishlistItem**: Created a new `wishlist_items` table to store user wishlist items.

### 2. Data Types and Constraints

We've updated data types and added constraints to ensure data integrity:

- Added NOT NULL constraints to required fields
- Set appropriate default values
- Added foreign key constraints
- Added check constraints for fields with limited valid values

### 3. Indexes and Performance

We've added indexes to improve query performance:

- Created indexes on foreign keys
- Created indexes on fields commonly used in WHERE clauses
- Created unique indexes where appropriate

### 4. Row Level Security (RLS)

We've enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables and created policies to ensure that users can only access their own data:

- Users can view their own data
- Users can insert their own data
- Users can update their own data
- Users can delete their own data

## Documentation Created

We've created the following documentation to support the schema alignment:

1. **Entity-Database Mapping**: A detailed mapping between domain entities and database tables.
2. **Migration Plan**: A plan for migrating the database schema to align with clean architecture.
3. **README**: An overview of the database schema and migrations.
4. **Schema Alignment Summary**: This document, summarizing the changes made.

## Next Steps

### 1. Data Migration

Now that the schema is aligned, the next step is to migrate existing data to match the new schema:

- Migrate data from legacy tables to new tables
- Update data to match new constraints
- Validate data integrity after migration

### 2. Repository Implementation

Update the repository implementations to work with the aligned schema:

- Ensure repositories map between domain entities and database models correctly
- Add error handling for database operations
- Add validation for input data

### 3. Testing

Create tests to verify the repository implementations:

- Unit tests for mapping between domain entities and database models
- Integration tests for CRUD operations
- End-to-end tests for the entire application

### 4. Performance Optimization

After the initial implementation is working, optimize for performance:

- Add additional indexes for common queries
- Create materialized views for common reports
- Optimize query patterns

## Conclusion

The database schema alignment is a critical step in the clean architecture migration. By aligning the database schema with the domain entities, we ensure that the data layer can correctly support the business logic defined in the domain layer.

The changes made in this alignment will make it easier to implement the repository pattern, which is a key component of clean architecture. With the repository pattern, the domain layer can remain independent of the data layer, making the code more maintainable and testable.
