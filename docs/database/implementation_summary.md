# Database Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the database schema alignment and data migration for the Dayliz App. The goal was to align the Supabase database schema with the clean architecture domain entities and migrate existing data to match the new schema.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Schema Alignment

We updated the database schema to align with the domain entities:

- **Address**: Updated the `addresses` table with fields like `address_type`, `landmark`, and `recipient_name`
- **UserProfile**: Added `last_updated` and `profile_image_url` columns to the `user_profiles` table
- **PaymentMethod**: Added `name` and `details` columns to the `payment_methods` table
- **CartItem**: Added `added_at`, `selected`, and `saved_for_later` columns to the `cart_items` table
- **WishlistItem**: Created a new `wishlist_items` table

### 2. Data Migration

We migrated existing data to match the new schema:

- **Payment Methods**: Converted legacy payment method data to the new format with `name` and `details`
- **Addresses**: Created coordinates JSON from latitude and longitude, migrated label to address_type
- **Cart Items**: Set default values for added_at, selected, and saved_for_later
- **Orders**: Calculated subtotal, tax, and shipping for orders
- **User Profiles**: Set preferences to empty JSON, set last_updated to updated_at, migrated avatar_url to profile_image_url

### 3. Validation

We validated the data migration to ensure data integrity:

- Checked that all required fields have been migrated
- Verified data integrity across all tables
- Ensured all constraints are satisfied

## Repository Implementation

We reviewed the existing repository implementations to ensure they work with the updated schema:

- **UserProfileRepositoryImpl**: Handles user profile data and addresses
- **UserProfileSupabaseAdapter**: Implements the UserProfileDataSource interface using Supabase

The repository implementation follows clean architecture principles:

1. **Domain-Centric**: Repositories return domain entities, not data models
2. **Error Handling**: Repositories handle data source errors and convert them to domain failures
3. **Network Awareness**: Repositories check for network connectivity before making remote requests
4. **Caching**: Repositories cache data locally for offline access

## Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation to support the implementation:

1. **Entity-Database Mapping**: A detailed mapping between domain entities and database tables
2. **Migration Plan**: A plan for migrating the database schema to align with clean architecture
3. **Repository Implementation**: Documentation of the repository implementation
4. **Implementation Summary**: This document, summarizing the implementation

## Next Steps

### 1. Performance Optimization

Now that the schema is aligned and data is migrated, the next step is to optimize for performance:

- Create additional indexes for common queries
- Optimize query patterns
- Add materialized views for common reports

### 2. Advanced Features

After performance optimization, we can implement advanced features:

- Full-text search for products
- Geospatial queries for address-based searches
- Real-time notifications for order status changes

### 3. Testing

Create tests to verify the repository implementations:

- Unit tests for mapping between domain entities and database models
- Integration tests for CRUD operations
- End-to-end tests for the entire application

## Conclusion

The database schema alignment and data migration are now complete. The Supabase database schema is aligned with the clean architecture domain entities, and existing data has been migrated to match the new schema.

The repository implementation follows clean architecture principles, providing a clean separation between the domain layer and the data layer. By abstracting away the details of data storage and retrieval, the domain layer can focus on business logic without being concerned with how data is stored or retrieved.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the clean architecture migration, making it easier to implement the repository pattern and ensuring that the data layer correctly supports the domain layer.
