üìã Dayliz Mobile App: Final Production Readiness & Security Audit
‚úÖ What is Production-Ready
Modern Architecture: Uses Clean Architecture, Riverpod, GetIt, and strong separation of concerns (lib/core, lib/domain, lib/data, lib/presentation).
State Management: Riverpod is a robust, scalable choice.
Dependency Injection: GetIt is used for modularity.
Functional Programming: Dartz, fpdart, equatable for immutability and value equality.
API/Network: Uses Dio and http, with connectivity checks and caching.
Local Storage: Hive, shared_preferences, sqflite for persistence.
Testing: Widget, unit, and integration tests exist (test/, integration_test/).
Lints: Uses flutter_lints for code quality.
.env Management: Sensitive keys are not hardcoded in the example file.
README: Clear setup, tech stack, and structure documentation.
Feature Flags: .env.example supports toggling analytics, push, caching.
Modular UI: Uses reusable widgets/components.
‚ùó What is Broken, Risky, or Missing
1. Security & Compliance (Critical)
Secrets in Repo: client_secret_897976702780-...json and similar files are present in the repo. These must never be committed (risk: credential leak, GCP ban, account takeover).
API Keys in .env.example: Example file is fine, but check for accidental .env or real keys in repo.
No Evidence of HTTPS Enforcement: No code or docs enforcing HTTPS for API calls or webviews.
Session/Token Management: No clear evidence of secure, httpOnly, or Secure cookies for refresh tokens. JWT handling code not reviewed in detail‚Äîrisk of XSS/CSRF if not handled securely.
No Security Headers: No mention of CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc. (relevant if using webview or Flutter web).
No Explicit Role-Based Access Control: No clear code for RBAC or endpoint-level authorization checks.
No Audit Logging: No code for user action audit logs (required for compliance).
No GDPR/DPDP Mechanisms: No code for user data export/delete or consent management.
No PCI-DSS Evidence: If handling payments, must NOT store card data; ensure all payment flows use tokenization and PCI-compliant gateways (Razorpay is present, but verify integration).
2. Technical Readiness
Debug Prints in Production: Widespread use of print and debugPrint (e.g., lib/presentation/widgets/product/clean_product_card.dart). These leak sensitive info and bloat logs in prod.
No Health/Readiness Endpoints: No clear health check for backend APIs.
No Crash/Error Reporting Integration: No Sentry/Crashlytics or similar.
No Monitoring/Alerting Hooks: No evidence of monitoring hooks or alerting for failures.
3. Code Quality & Architecture
Dead/Test Code in Production Build: Test files (test_*, debug_*, test_google_signin.dart, etc.) are present in lib/. These risk accidental inclusion in builds.
TODOs and Incomplete Features: Many // TODO: comments in widgets and screens.
Duplicate Logic: Cart logic, error handling, and debug prints are repeated in multiple widgets.
Large Files: main.dart is 47kB‚Äîlikely violates SRP and maintainability.
Tight Coupling: Some widgets directly import business logic (core/services/...), risking coupling.
4. Performance & Optimization
No Evidence of Bundle Size Optimization: No code splitting or lazy loading for heavy screens.
No Explicit Pagination/Batching: API calls may risk over-fetching.
No Caching Strategy for Lists: Only image caching is explicit.
No Worker Queues/Background Tasks: No offloading of heavy tasks.
5. Redundancy & Dead Code
Test/Debug Files in Main Tree: test_cart_sync.dart, test_google_signin.dart, etc. in lib/.
Commented-Out Code: Some commented code and TODOs remain.
Unused Imports: Some files import modules not used.
6. Scalability & Load Readiness
No Evidence of Horizontal Scaling: No statelessness or session management for scaling.
No DB Sharding/Partitioning: Not visible in mobile, but check backend.
No Microservice Hooks: Monolithic API base URL.
7. Testing & CI/CD
Test Coverage Unclear: Only basic widget/unit tests. No code coverage badge or report.
No Staging/Smoke Test Evidence: No mention of staging environment or smoke/rollback plans.
No CI/CD Pipeline Files Shown: No .github/workflows or similar referenced.
8. Frontend/UI/UX
No Accessibility (WCAG) Checks: No code or docs for a11y.
No Mobile/Tablet Responsiveness Tests: No explicit device matrix.
No Lazy Loading/Code Splitting: All widgets likely loaded upfront.
No LCP/CLS/SEO Optimization: Not relevant for pure mobile, but if web is supported, not addressed.
üß∞ Recommended Fixes and Enhancements
Security & Compliance
Remove all secrets from repo; rotate any exposed credentials immediately.
Enforce HTTPS for all API calls; add checks in code.
Implement secure token storage (httpOnly, Secure cookies, encrypted storage).
Add RBAC checks for all sensitive API calls.
Add audit logging for user actions.
Implement GDPR/DPDP data export/delete and consent flows.
Ensure PCI-DSS: never store card data, use only PCI-compliant gateways.
Add security headers for webviews/web.
Technical Readiness
Replace all debugPrint/print with a production-grade logger (with log levels).
Add health/readiness endpoints for backend.
Integrate crash/error reporting (Sentry, Crashlytics).
Add monitoring/alerting for failures.
Code Quality
Move all test/debug files out of lib/ and into test/ or exclude from prod builds.
Remove all TODOs and commented-out code.
Refactor large files (e.g., main.dart) into smaller, focused modules.
Extract reusable logic into services/helpers.
Performance
Implement code splitting/lazy loading for heavy screens.
Add pagination/batching to API calls.
Add caching for product/category lists.
Offload heavy tasks to background isolates/workers.
Redundancy
Remove unused files/imports.
Deduplicate repeated logic/components.
Scalability
Ensure all API calls and sessions are stateless for scaling.
Prepare for DB sharding/partitioning if needed.
Modularize API endpoints for future microservices.
Testing & CI/CD
Add/expand test coverage; generate coverage reports.
Add staging environment, smoke tests, and rollback plans.
Document CI/CD pipeline and ensure secrets are injected securely.
Frontend/UI/UX
Audit and fix accessibility issues (labels, contrast, screen reader).
Test on a wide device matrix for responsiveness.
Implement lazy loading for images/lists.
Add loading/error UI states.
