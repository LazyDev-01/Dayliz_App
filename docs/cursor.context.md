🧠 CONTEXT: You are building a modern q-commerce mobile app called **Dayliz** that delivers groceries and essentials in Northeast India. The design should be optimized for semi-urban and urban users aged 12–60+, many of whom are new to online shopping. UX must prioritize clarity, speed, and trust.

Whenever you work on UI components, follow these key rules:

### ✅ Visual Design Principles:
- Use **rounded corners (16–24px)**, soft shadows, and a minimalist, clean layout.
- Keep color palette fresh and vibrant: **Primary = #38B000 (green), white backgrounds, soft greys for contrast.**
- Typography: Use only two font weights – Regular for content, Bold for emphasis (headings, prices).
- Icons should be simple, friendly, and intuitive (use emoji-like cues where needed, e.g., 🔍, 🛒, 🎤).
- Use **skeleton loaders (shimmer)** for loading screens instead of spinners.

### 📱 Product Card Design:
- Show image, name (max 2 lines), price (with MRP slash if discounted), weight/size, and Add to Cart button.
- When “Add to Cart” is clicked, show quantity stepper (+ / –).
- If stock is low, display “Only X left!” as a red badge or text.
- Use soft elevation and consistent spacing in grid layout (2-column format on mobile).

### 🏠 Home Screen Guidelines:
- Top section: show current location + estimated delivery time.
- Prominent sticky search bar with **voice input 🎤** and **image search 📷** icons (future-ready).
- Horizontal scroll categories with images or icons.
- Sections: 🔥 Hot Deals Today, 🛒 Buy Again, 🌟 Recommended for You (horizontal carousels).
- Bottom nav bar with: Home 🏠, Categories 🧺, Orders 📦, Profile 👤.

### 🎯 UX Notes:
- Design for speed-tapping and one-hand usability.
- Provide feedback for every tap (ripple effect, animation).
- Prioritize accessibility: readable text sizes, good contrast, generous tap targets.
- Keep designs modular and reuse components for consistency.

👉 Anytime you modify UI, **follow this guide** to ensure consistent, modern, and user-friendly experience.

🚀 TL;DR: Think Blinkit or Zepto vibes, but adapted for first-time online shoppers in small towns.
