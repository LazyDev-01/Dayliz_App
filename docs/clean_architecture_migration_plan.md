## Implementation Guidelines

### Feature Migration Process

For each feature, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the existing implementation**
   - Identify current functionality and data flow
   - Document API endpoints and data structures

2. **Create domain layer components**
   - Define entities with required properties and methods
   - Create repository interfaces with clear method signatures
   - Implement use cases for specific business operations

3. **Implement data layer**
   - Create models that extend domain entities
   - Implement remote data sources for API communication
   - Implement local data sources for caching/offline support
   - Create repository implementations that handle data flow

4. **Refactor presentation layer**
   - Create providers that use the new use cases
   - Update UI to use the new providers
   - Ensure error handling and loading states are properly handled

5. **Test thoroughly**
   - Write unit tests for domain and data layers
   - Write widget tests for UI components
   - Perform manual testing of the complete feature

### Best Practices

1. **Keep backward compatibility** - Ensure the app remains functional throughout the migration process
2. **One feature at a time** - Complete each feature before moving to the next
3. **Comprehensive testing** - Write tests for each component to ensure reliability
4. **Documentation** - Document your implementation choices and architecture decisions
5. **Consistent naming conventions** - Follow consistent naming patterns across all layers
6. **Dependency Management** - Carefully manage dependencies to avoid conflicts:
   - Temporarily comment out or create stub implementations for removed dependencies
   - Use proper version constraints to maintain compatibility
   - Move location-based and permission-handling functionality to proper layers when implementing
   - Create fallback implementations for removed functionality to maintain UI flow
7. **Type Safety** - Use appropriate type aliases and ensure consistent typing throughout the app to avoid conflicts
8. **Platform-Specific Handling** - Implement platform-specific code where necessary (web vs. mobile) through abstraction
