## Implementation Guidelines

### Feature Migration Process

For each feature, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the existing implementation**
   - Identify current functionality and data flow
   - Document API endpoints and data structures

2. **Create domain layer components**
   - Define entities with required properties and methods
   - Create repository interfaces with clear method signatures
   - Implement use cases for specific business operations

3. **Implement data layer**
   - Create models that extend domain entities
   - Implement remote data sources for API communication
   - Implement local data sources for caching/offline support
   - Create repository implementations that handle data flow

4. **Refactor presentation layer**
   - Create providers that use the new use cases
   - Update UI to use the new providers
   - Ensure error handling and loading states are properly handled

5. **Test thoroughly**
   - Write unit tests for domain and data layers
   - Write widget tests for UI components
   - Perform manual testing of the complete feature

### Best Practices

1. **Keep backward compatibility** - Ensure the app remains functional throughout the migration process
2. **One feature at a time** - Complete each feature before moving to the next
3. **Comprehensive testing** - Write tests for each component to ensure reliability
4. **Documentation** - Document your implementation choices and architecture decisions
5. **Consistent naming conventions** - Follow consistent naming patterns across all layers
6. **Dependency Management** - Carefully manage dependencies to avoid conflicts:
   - Temporarily comment out or create stub implementations for removed dependencies
   - Use proper version constraints to maintain compatibility
   - Move location-based and permission-handling functionality to proper layers when implementing
   - Create fallback implementations for removed functionality to maintain UI flow
7. **Type Safety** - Use appropriate type aliases and ensure consistent typing throughout the app to avoid conflicts
8. **Platform-Specific Handling** - Implement platform-specific code where necessary (web vs. mobile) through abstraction

     - Added network connectivity checks

   - âœ… Presentation Layer (55% complete):
     - Developed Riverpod providers for state management
     - Created UI components with proper loading, error, and empty states
     - Implemented navigation between clean architecture screens
     - Added form validation and user feedback

2. **Screen Migration Progress**
   - âœ… Completed Screens (fully migrated, legacy removed):
     - Product Listing Screen
     - Product Details Screen
     - Categories Screen
     - Search Screen
     - Wishlist Screen
     - Splash Screen
     - Email Verification Screen
     - Home Screen
     - Cart Screen
     - Checkout Screen
     - User Profile Screen
     - Orders Screen
     - Address Management Screen

   - âœ… Activated Screens (clean implementation active, legacy still exists):
     - None (all core screens have been migrated)

   - ðŸ”² Screens Yet to Be Implemented:
     - Password Reset/Update Screen
     - Notifications Screen
     - Settings Screen (partial implementation exists)
     - Privacy Policy Screen
     - Support Screen
     - Wallet Screen

   - ðŸ”„ Development/Debug Screens (to be kept as legacy):
     - Google Sign-In Debug Screen
     - Database Seeder Screen
     - Settings Screen (development toggles)
     - Other Debug Utilities

3. **Backend Integration**
   - ðŸ”„ Database Schema Alignment (in progress):
     - Started analysis of existing Supabase schema vs. clean architecture entities
     - Identified key tables that need alignment
     - Documented required changes to match entity models

   - ðŸ”² API Integration (planned):
     - Prepared repository implementations for real API connections
     - Designed error handling for API failures
     - Created models for API response mapping

These implementations maintain backward compatibility while gradually moving towards the clean architecture structure. The experience has emphasized the importance of careful dependency management and incremental changes to ensure the app remains functional throughout the migration process.

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Platform-Specific Handling** - Implemented abstractions to handle web vs. mobile differences
2. **Riverpod Integration** - Successfully migrated from static state management to Riverpod for reactive state management
3. **Code Organization** - Maintained clean separation between layers while allowing for backward compatibility
4. **Proper Error Handling** - Implemented consistent error handling across all layers using Either pattern from dartz
5. **UI/UX Consistency** - Maintained consistent UI/UX patterns between legacy and new screens
6. **Dependency Injection** - Successfully implemented and registered all dependencies using GetIt service locator
7. **Type Safety** - Used domain aliases to avoid type conflicts between domain and data layers
8. **Incremental Migration** - Successfully validated that incremental migration works well, allowing features to be migrated one at a time
9. **Parallel Implementations** - Demonstrated that running parallel implementations (legacy and clean) is an effective migration strategy
10. **State Management** - Properly implemented state handling with clear separation of concerns
11. **Demo Screens** - Created effective demo screens that showcase the clean architecture implementations
12. **Navigation** - Successfully integrated with GoRouter and maintained consistent navigation patterns
13. **Testing** - Manual testing proved efficient during migration, though automated tests are needed
