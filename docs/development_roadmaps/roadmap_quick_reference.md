- [ ] **Phase 3C**: Card payments via Razorpay (deferred)

## STRICT RULES

### ❌ DO NOT
- Add new features until current phase complete
- Modify legacy code (focus on clean architecture only)
- Change architecture without roadmap update
- Skip testing or code review
- Miss daily standups or weekly reviews

### ✅ DO
- Follow clean architecture principles strictly
- Write unit tests for all new code (>80% coverage)
- Update documentation for changes
- Escalate blockers within 24 hours
- Track progress against roadmap daily

## QUALITY GATES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Code Quality
- [ ] Clean architecture compliance
- [ ] Unit tests >80% coverage
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Proper error handling

### Performance
- [ ] App launch <3s
- [ ] Checkout flow <10s
- [ ] COD order processing <3s
- [ ] Maps loading <3s
- [ ] No memory leaks

### Security
- [ ] API keys properly secured
- [ ] COD order data protected
- [ ] User data protected
- [ ] Security audit passed

## ESCALATION PROCESS

1. **Blocker Identified** → Immediate team notification
2. **24 Hours** → Escalate to tech lead if unresolved
3. **48 Hours** → Stakeholder meeting if still blocked
4. **Timeline Impact** → Roadmap update required

## LAUNCH CRITERIA CHECKLIST

### Technical (Must Have)
- [ ] All Phase 3A tasks completed (100%)
- [ ] Zero P0 (critical) bugs
- [ ] <5 P1 (high) bugs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security audit passed

### Business (Must Have)
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] App store assets prepared
- [ ] Legal compliance verified
- [ ] Support documentation ready

## COMMUNICATION SCHEDULE

- **Daily Standups**: 9:00 AM (15 min max)
- **Weekly Reviews**: Friday 4:00 PM (1 hour)
- **Progress Updates**: Daily via project management tool
- **Blocker Alerts**: Immediate via team chat

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP CHECKLIST

### Required API Keys (Phase 3A)
- [ ] Google Maps API Key
- [ ] Google Places API Key
- [ ] Supabase URL + Anon Key
- [ ] Firebase Configuration

### Future API Keys
- [ ] UPI Provider Keys (Phase 3B)
- [ ] Razorpay Keys (Phase 3C - Deferred)

### Development Tools
- [ ] Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- [ ] Android Studio / VS Code
- [ ] Git with proper branch strategy
- [ ] Testing framework setup
- [ ] Code coverage tools

## RISK MITIGATION

### High Risk Items
1. **COD Order Management Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Simple COD flow with clear tracking
   - Fallback: Manual order processing initially

2. **Google Maps API Costs**
   - Mitigation: Usage monitoring
   - Fallback: Manual address entry

3. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Mitigation: 20% buffer time
   - Fallback: Feature prioritization

4. **UPI Integration (Phase 3B)**
   - Mitigation: Research multiple providers
   - Fallback: Defer to later release

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Development Metrics
- Tasks completed on time: >90%
- Code coverage: >80%
- Bug escape rate: <5%
- Code review turnaround: <24h

### Launch Metrics
- App store rating: >4.0
- Crash rate: <1%
- Order completion: >80%
- User retention (Day 7): >60%

## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Backend Strategy
- **Primary**: Supabase (100% functional, launch-ready)
- **Secondary**: FastAPI (exists but not integrated, post-launch)
- **Focus**: Complete Supabase integration, defer FastAPI

### Clean Architecture Status
- **Domain Layer**: 100% complete
- **Data Layer**: 95% complete (payment + maps pending)
- **Presentation Layer**: 90% complete (polish pending)
- **Legacy Code**: Being systematically removed

### Database Status
- **Schema**: 100% aligned with clean architecture
- **Performance**: Optimized with indexes and views
- **Security**: RLS policies implemented
- **Features**: Full-text search, geospatial queries ready
