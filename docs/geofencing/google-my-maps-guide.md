# üìç Complete Step-by-Step Guide: Creating Geofence Boundaries with Google My Maps

## üéØ Step 1: Access Google My Maps

1. **Open your web browser** and go to [https://mymaps.google.com](https://mymaps.google.com)
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Click "Create a New Map"** (big red button)

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Step 2: Set Up Your Map

1. **Click "Untitled map"** at the top left
2. **Rename your map** to: `"Dayliz Delivery Zones - Tura"`
3. **Add description**: `"Geofence boundaries for Dayliz app delivery zones in Tura, Meghalaya"`
4. **Click "Save"**

---

## üîç Step 3: Navigate to Tura

1. **In the search box** (top left), type: `"Tura, Meghalaya, India"`
2. **Press Enter** or click search
3. **The map will zoom** to Tura area
4. **Adjust zoom level** to see Main Bazaar area clearly (zoom in more for precision)

---

## üìê Step 4: Create Zone-1 Polygon

### 4.1 Start Drawing:
1. **Click "Add layer"** (below the search box)
2. **Rename the layer** to: `"Zone-1 Main Bazaar"`
3. **Click "Draw a line"** icon (looks like a pen/line tool)
4. **Select "Add line or shape"** from dropdown
5. **Choose "Add polygon"** (not line)

### 4.2 Draw the Boundary:
1. **Find Main Bazaar** on the map (search for "Main Bazaar, Tura" if needed)
2. **Start clicking points** around the delivery area:
   - Click at the **northernmost point** of your delivery area
   - Move **clockwise** around the boundary
   - Click at **each corner/turn** of your delivery zone
   - Include all 5-6 areas you want to cover
   - **Be generous** - it's easier to shrink later than expand

### 4.3 Complete the Polygon:
1. **Click back on the first point** to close the polygon
2. **The area will fill** with a colored overlay
3. **Click "Done"** when satisfied

### 4.4 Customize Appearance:
1. **Click on the polygon** you just created
2. **Click the paint bucket icon** to change colors
3. **Choose a color** (maybe green for active zones)
4. **Add a name**: `"Zone-1: Main Bazaar Area"`
5. **Add description**: `"Primary delivery zone covering Main Bazaar and surrounding 5-6 areas"`

---

## üì§ Step 5: Export the Data

### 5.1 Export as KML:
1. **Click the 3-dot menu** (‚ãÆ) next to your map title
2. **Select "Export to KML/KMZ"**
3. **Choose "Export to KML"** (not KMZ)
4. **Select your layer**: "Zone-1 Main Bazaar"
5. **Click "Download"**
6. **Save the file** as: `tura-zone-1.kml`

---

## üîß Step 6: Extract Coordinates

### 6.1 Open KML File:
1. **Open the downloaded KML file** in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. **Look for the `<coordinates>` section**
3. **You'll see something like:**
```xml
<coordinates>
90.2065,25.5138,0 90.2070,25.5145,0 90.2075,25.5142,0 90.2068,25.5135,0 90.2065,25.5138,0
</coordinates>
```

### 6.2 Understanding the Format:
- **Format**: `longitude,latitude,altitude`
- **Altitude** is always 0 (ignore it)
- **Each point** is separated by a space

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 7: Convert to Flutter Format

### 7.1 Manual Conversion:
Take the coordinates from KML and convert to this format:

**From KML:**
```
90.2065,25.5138,0 90.2070,25.5145,0 90.2075,25.5142,0
```

**To Flutter:**
```dart
final zone1Boundary = [
  LatLng(25.5138, 90.2065), // Note: lat first, then lng
  LatLng(25.5145, 90.2070),
  LatLng(25.5142, 90.2075),
  // ... more points
];
```

### 7.2 Automated Conversion Tool:
I can create a simple converter for you:

```dart
// Paste this in a Dart file and run it
void convertKMLCoordinates(String kmlCoordinates) {
  final points = kmlCoordinates.trim().split(' ');
  print('final zoneBoundary = [');
  
  for (final point in points) {
    final coords = point.split(',');
    if (coords.length >= 2) {
      final lng = coords[0];
      final lat = coords[1];
      print('  LatLng($lat, $lng),');
    }
  }
  
  print('];');
}

// Usage:
void main() {
  const kmlCoords = "90.2065,25.5138,0 90.2070,25.5145,0 90.2075,25.5142,0";
  convertKMLCoordinates(kmlCoords);
}
```

## ‚úÖ Step 8: Verify Your Polygon

### 8.1 Visual Check:
1. **Go back to Google My Maps**
2. **Verify the polygon** covers all intended areas
3. **Check for gaps** or unwanted inclusions
4. **Adjust if needed** by clicking and dragging points

### 8.2 Test Points:
1. **Add test markers** inside and outside the zone
2. **Right-click** ‚Üí "Add marker"
3. **Verify coverage** of key locations

---

## üîÑ Step 9: Create Additional Zones (Future)

### For Zone-2, Zone-3, etc.:
1. **Click "Add layer"** in the same map
2. **Name it**: `"Zone-2 [Area Name]"`
3. **Repeat the polygon drawing process**
4. **Use different colors** for each zone
5. **Export each layer separately**

---

## üìã Step 10: Implementation Checklist

### Before You Start:
- [ ] Google account ready
- [ ] Clear idea of Zone-1 boundaries
- [ ] List of 5-6 areas to include

### After Creating:
- [ ] Polygon covers all intended areas
- [ ] No major gaps or overlaps
- [ ] KML file downloaded
- [ ] Coordinates extracted
- [ ] Converted to Flutter format

## üéØ Pro Tips

### Accuracy Tips:
- **Zoom in close** when drawing boundaries
- **Follow roads/landmarks** for realistic boundaries
- **Include buffer zones** around area edges
- **Test with satellite view** for better precision

### Performance Tips:
- **Don't use too many points** (20-30 max per polygon)
- **Simplify complex shapes** where possible
- **Avoid tiny details** that don't matter for delivery

### Planning Tips:
- **Start conservative** - easier to expand than contract
- **Consider traffic patterns** and road accessibility
- **Think about delivery logistics** when drawing boundaries
- **Leave room for growth** in adjacent areas

## üöÄ Next Steps After Creating

1. **Share the coordinates** with the development team
2. **Implement the geofencing logic** in the app
3. **Test with real Tura locations**
4. **Integrate with location search screen**
