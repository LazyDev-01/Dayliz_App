# Remaining Screens Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing the remaining screens in the clean architecture migration of the Dayliz App. These screens are either not yet implemented or only partially implemented in the clean architecture structure.

| Email Verification | High | Medium | Authentication | ðŸ”² Not Started |
| Password Reset/Update | High | Medium | Authentication | ðŸ”² Not Started |
| Search | Medium | High | Products, Categories | ðŸ”„ Partial (30%) |
| Settings | Medium | Medium | User Preferences | ðŸ”„ Partial (20%) |
| Notifications | Low | High | Backend Services | ðŸ”² Not Started |
| Privacy Policy | Low | Low | None | ðŸ”² Not Started |
| Support | Low | Medium | None | ðŸ”² Not Started |
| Wallet | Low | High | Payment Services | ðŸ”² Not Started |

- Presentation Layer:
  - Create PasswordResetScreen and PasswordUpdateScreen
  - Add appropriate state management
  - Implement UI with form validation

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Update domain layer with password management methods
2. Implement data layer components
3. Create UI components with proper validation
4. Connect with authentication flow
5. Test password reset and update processes

### 3. Search Screen

**Purpose**: Allow users to search for products with filters and sorting options.

**Current Status**: Partial implementation exists (30%)

**Components Needed**:
- Domain Layer:
  - Extend ProductRepository with advanced search methods
  - Create SearchProductsUseCase with filtering options
- Data Layer:
  - Implement search methods in ProductRepositoryImpl
  - Update ProductRemoteDataSource for search API
- Presentation Layer:
  - Complete CleanSearchScreen implementation
  - Add SearchState and SearchNotifier
  - Implement UI with search input, filters, and results display

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Complete domain layer search functionality
2. Enhance data layer with advanced search capabilities
3. Finish UI implementation with filters and sorting
4. Add search history functionality
5. Implement search suggestions

### 4. Settings Screen

**Purpose**: Allow users to manage app settings and preferences.

**Current Status**: Partial implementation exists (20%)

**Components Needed**:
- Domain Layer:
  - Extend UserPreferences entity with additional settings
  - Update UserProfileRepository with settings methods
- Data Layer:
  - Implement settings methods in UserProfileRepositoryImpl
  - Update data sources for settings storage
- Presentation Layer:
  - Complete CleanSettingsScreen implementation
  - Add SettingsState and SettingsNotifier
  - Implement UI with various settings options

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Enhance domain layer with comprehensive settings options
2. Update data layer for settings persistence
3. Complete UI implementation with all settings categories
4. Add theme switching functionality
5. Implement language selection if needed

## Implementation Priority

1. **Email Verification Screen** - High priority for security and user experience
2. **Password Reset/Update Screen** - High priority for account security
3. **Search Screen** - Medium priority but important for product discovery
4. **Settings Screen** - Medium priority for user customization
5. **Notifications Screen** - Lower priority, can be implemented later
6. **Privacy Policy & Support Screens** - Lower priority, simple content screens
7. **Wallet Screen** - Lowest priority, complex feature that depends on payment services

## Timeline Estimate

| Screen | Estimated Time | Target Completion |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Email Verification | 3-4 days | Week 1 |
| Password Reset/Update | 3-4 days | Week 1 |
| Search | 5-7 days | Week 2-3 |
| Settings | 3-5 days | Week 3 |
| Notifications | 5-7 days | Week 4-5 |
| Privacy Policy | 1-2 days | Week 5 |
| Support | 2-3 days | Week 5 |
| Wallet | 7-10 days | Week 6-7 |

## Testing Strategy

Each screen implementation should include:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test use cases with various scenarios
   - Test repository implementations
   - Test data source implementations

2. **Widget Tests**:
   - Test UI components in isolation
   - Test form validation
   - Test state management

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test screen navigation
   - Test data flow between components
   - Test interaction with other features

## Conclusion

Implementing these remaining screens will complete the clean architecture migration of the Dayliz App. The focus should be on high-priority screens first, with a systematic approach to ensure each screen follows clean architecture principles and maintains consistency with the rest of the application.
