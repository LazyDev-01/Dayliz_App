# Auth Screen Migration Guide

This document outlines the completed migration from legacy auth screens to clean architecture auth screens in the Dayliz App.

## Current Implementation

The Dayliz App now uses only clean architecture authentication screens:

- **Clean Architecture Auth Screens**: Located in `lib/presentation/screens/auth/`
  - `clean_login_screen.dart` (mapped to `/login`)
  - `clean_register_screen.dart` (mapped to `/signup`)
  - `clean_forgot_password_screen.dart` (mapped to `/reset-password`)

## Navigation

The router has been updated to use the clean architecture auth screens as the default:

- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- Legacy routes (`/clean/login`, `/clean/register`, etc.) are redirected to their new counterparts

## Completed Migration

The migration to clean architecture auth screens has been completed:

1. **Phase 1: Parallel Implementation**
   - Both implementations were available
   - Feature flag controlled which was used by default
   - Clean architecture auth was set as the default

2. **Phase 2: Feature Parity**
   - Clean architecture auth screens achieved feature parity with legacy screens
   - All necessary functionality was implemented

3. **Phase 3: Complete Migration (Current)**
   - Legacy auth screens have been removed
   - Clean architecture auth screens are now the default
   - Routes have been updated to use standard paths
   - Feature flag has been removed

## Known Issues

- Email verification screen needs to be implemented in clean architecture
- Password update screen needs to be implemented in clean architecture

These screens are currently redirected to the login screen until they are implemented.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Missing Screens**:
   - Create clean architecture email verification screen
   - Create clean architecture password update screen

2. **Enhance Authentication Flows**:
   - Improve error handling and validation
   - Add "Remember Me" functionality
   - Implement proper loading states

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Ensure consistent styling across all auth screens
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Improve accessibility

4. **Testing and Maintenance**:
   - Implement comprehensive testing for auth flows
   - Monitor for any issues in production
   - Document authentication architecture for future reference
