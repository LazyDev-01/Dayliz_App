# Dayliz App Project Status Update

## Executive Summary

The Dayliz App project has successfully completed **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**, establishing the core infrastructure and components needed for the application. All planned features for this phase have been implemented and tested, providing a solid foundation for subsequent development phases.

## Progress Overview

### Phase 1 Completion (100%)

We have successfully implemented:

- **Authentication System**: Full user authentication flow with Supabase, including registration, login, password reset, and session persistence
- **Design System**: Comprehensive design system with typography, colors, spacing, and theming support
- **Custom Components**: Reusable UI components library with consistent styling and behavior
- **Navigation**: Robust routing system with GoRouter, including authentication guards and deep linking
- **Backend Foundation**: Core database models, CRUD operations, and seed data for development

### Key Achievements

1. **Technical Infrastructure**: Established a solid foundation with modern architecture using Flutter, Riverpod, and Supabase
2. **Authentication**: Implemented secure authentication with token refresh and persistence
3. **Reusable Components**: Created a library of reusable UI components following the design system
4. **Testing**: Successfully tested the app on physical devices, validating core functionality

### Issues Identified

During testing, we identified several minor issues that will be addressed in Phase 2:
- Image loading issues with Unsplash URLs
- Minor UI overflow in some components
- Database schema mismatches between the model class and Supabase tables

## Phase 2 Planning

We are now ready to begin **Phase 2: Product Browsing + UI Polish**, which will focus on:

1. **Product Catalog**: Creating comprehensive product listing functionality with filtering, search, and pagination
2. **UI Implementation**: Building engaging product browsing screens with fluid interactions
3. **Cart Functionality**: Implementing a full-featured shopping cart with persistence
4. **Animations & Polish**: Adding polished transitions and micro-interactions

### Timeline

Phase 2 is scheduled to take 2-3 weeks, with an estimated completion date of [Target Date].

### Key Deliverables

- Product catalog API endpoints with search and filtering
- Home screen with featured products and categories
- Product detail screen with comprehensive information display
- Shopping cart implementation with local persistence
- Polished UI animations and transitions

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing the product catalog API endpoints
2. Refine the product database schema to support all browsing features
3. Start developing the home screen UI with product browsing
4. Address the minor issues identified in Phase 1

## Conclusion

The successful completion of Phase 1 has established a strong foundation for the Dayliz App. The team is now well-positioned to move forward with the more user-facing features in Phase 2, bringing us closer to a market-ready product.
