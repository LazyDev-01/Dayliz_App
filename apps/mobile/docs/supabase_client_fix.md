# Supabase Client Registration Fix

## Issue

The app was encountering the following error when trying to load the home screen:

```
Bad state: GetIt: Object/factory with type SupabaseClient is not registered inside GetIt.
(Did you accidentally do GetIt sl=GetIt.instance(); instead of GetIt sl=GetIt.instance;
Did you forget to register it?)
```

This error occurred because the app was trying to use the SupabaseClient through GetIt (a service locator/dependency injection container), but the SupabaseClient wasn't properly registered.

## Root Cause

1. The dependency injection system was trying to use the SupabaseClient before it was registered in the GetIt container.
2. Several data sources were directly accessing Supabase.instance.client instead of getting it from the dependency injection container.
3. The initialization order in main.dart wasn't ensuring that Supabase was fully initialized before the dependency injection system was set up.

## Solution

1. **Updated Dependency Injection**:
   - Added explicit registration of SupabaseClient in the GetIt container
   - Added error handling to gracefully handle cases where Supabase isn't initialized yet

2. **Updated Initialization Order**:
   - Ensured Supabase is initialized before the dependency injection system
   - Added explicit checks to verify Supabase initialization

3. **Updated Data Source Factories**:
   - Modified AuthDataSourceFactory and CartDataSourceFactory to try getting SupabaseClient from GetIt first
   - Added fallback to direct Supabase.instance.client access if GetIt registration fails
   - Added debug logging to track which source is being used

4. **Added Debug Logging**:
   - Added logging to data sources to help diagnose initialization issues
   - Added logging to track Supabase client initialization

## Benefits

1. **More Robust Initialization**:
   - The app now handles Supabase initialization more gracefully
   - Proper dependency injection ensures consistent access to the Supabase client

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added fallback mechanisms to handle initialization edge cases
   - Improved logging to help diagnose issues

3. **Consistent Client Access**:
   - All components now access the Supabase client through the same mechanism
   - Reduced risk of using uninitialized clients

## Future Improvements

1. **Lazy Initialization**:
   - Consider implementing lazy initialization for the Supabase client to further improve startup time

2. **Centralized Error Handling**:
   - Add centralized error handling for Supabase client initialization issues

3. **Offline Mode Support**:
   - Enhance the app to gracefully handle cases where Supabase is unavailable
