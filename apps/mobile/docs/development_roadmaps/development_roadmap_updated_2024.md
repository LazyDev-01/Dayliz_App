## BACKEND STRATEGY CLARIFICATION

### Current Status (ACCURATE)
- ‚úÖ **Supabase**: Primary backend (100% functional)
  - All features implemented and tested
  - Database schema fully optimized
  - Real-time capabilities active
  - Row Level Security implemented

- üîÑ **FastAPI**: Secondary backend (exists but not integrated)
  - Complete backend implementation exists
  - No integration pathway defined
  - Not required for launch

### Post-Launch Strategy (Phase 6)
- **Month 1-2**: Define FastAPI integration strategy
- **Month 3-4**: Implement selective feature migration
- **Month 5-6**: Advanced features requiring custom logic

## STRICT ADHERENCE GUIDELINES

### **DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS PLAN**
1. **No new features** until current phase completion
2. **No architectural changes** without roadmap update
3. **No legacy code modifications** - focus on clean architecture only
4. **Weekly progress reviews** mandatory
5. **Blockers must be escalated** within 24 hours

### **Definition of Done for Each Task**
- [ ] Implementation completed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### **Quality Gates**
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Performance**: No regression in load times
- **Security**: All security scans passing
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## RISK MITIGATION

### **High Risk Items**
1. **COD Order Management Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Simple COD flow with clear order tracking
   - Fallback: Manual order processing initially

2. **Google Maps API Costs**
   - Mitigation: Implement usage limits and monitoring
   - Fallback: Manual address entry option

3. **Performance on Low-End Devices**
   - Mitigation: Regular testing on target devices
   - Fallback: Progressive feature loading

4. **UPI Integration Challenges (Phase 3B)**
   - Mitigation: Research multiple UPI providers
   - Fallback: Defer UPI to later release if needed

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Buffer Time**: 20% buffer built into each phase
- **Parallel Development**: Non-dependent tasks run in parallel
- **Daily Standups**: Track progress and identify blockers early

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **Launch Readiness Criteria**
- [ ] All Phase 3A tasks completed (100%)
- [ ] Critical bugs resolved (0 P0, <5 P1 bugs)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (app load <3s, checkout <10s)
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed

### **Post-Launch Metrics**
- App store rating >4.0
- Crash rate <1%
- Order completion rate >80%
- User retention >60% (Day 7)

## CONCLUSION

This roadmap provides a clear, actionable plan based on the actual current state of the Dayliz App. The team must strictly adhere to this plan to ensure successful launch within the defined timeline. Any deviations must be approved and documented with roadmap updates.

**Next Review Date**: Weekly on Fridays
**Roadmap Owner**: [Tech Lead]
**Stakeholder Approval Required**: Yes
