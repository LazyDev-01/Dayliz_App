# Database Performance Optimization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented for the Dayliz App database. The goal was to improve database performance, enable advanced search capabilities, and add real-time features to support the clean architecture implementation.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Indexing Strategy

We've implemented a comprehensive indexing strategy to improve query performance:

- **Product Search**: Created trigram-based indexes for text search on product names
- **Filtering**: Added indexes for common filtering operations (category, price, discount, etc.)
- **Sorting**: Added indexes to support efficient sorting of results
- **Foreign Keys**: Added indexes on all foreign key columns to improve join performance
- **Partial Indexes**: Created partial indexes for common queries (e.g., in-stock products only)

### 2. Materialized Views

We've created materialized views for common reports to improve read performance:

- **Product Statistics**: Aggregated product data including order count, wishlist count, and revenue
- **Category Statistics**: Aggregated category data including product count and revenue
- **User Order Statistics**: Aggregated user order data including order count and total spent

These materialized views are automatically refreshed when the underlying data changes, ensuring that reports always show the most up-to-date information.

### 3. Database Functions

We've created database functions for complex operations to reduce the amount of data transferred between the application and the database:

- **Cart Functions**: Get a user's cart with product details in a single query
- **Wishlist Functions**: Get a user's wishlist with product details in a single query
- **Order Functions**: Get a user's orders with details in a single query
- **Search Functions**: Search products with filtering, sorting, and pagination in a single query

These functions encapsulate complex SQL queries, making them easier to use and maintain.

### 4. Triggers

We've created triggers for automatic updates to ensure data consistency:

- **Updated At**: Automatically update the `updated_at` timestamp when a record is updated
- **Product Counts**: Automatically update product counts in subcategories when products are added or removed
- **Materialized Views**: Automatically refresh materialized views when the underlying data changes

### 5. Full-Text Search

We've implemented full-text search for products to improve search performance and relevance:

- **Search Vector**: Added a tsvector column to the products table
- **Automatic Updates**: Created a trigger to update the search vector when a product is updated
- **GIN Index**: Created a GIN index on the search vector for efficient searching
- **Search Function**: Created a function to search products using full-text search with filtering, sorting, and pagination

### 6. Geospatial Queries

We've implemented geospatial queries for addresses to support location-based features:

- **PostGIS Extension**: Added the PostGIS extension for geospatial functionality
- **Geometry Column**: Added a geometry column to the addresses table
- **Automatic Updates**: Created a trigger to update the geometry column when an address is updated
- **Spatial Index**: Created a spatial index on the geometry column for efficient searching
- **Radius Search**: Created a function to find addresses within a radius
- **Nearest Zone**: Created a function to find the nearest zone for an address

### 7. Real-Time Notifications

We've implemented real-time notifications for order status changes:

- **Notifications Table**: Created a table to store notifications
- **Automatic Creation**: Created a trigger to create a notification when an order status changes
- **Read Status**: Added functions to mark notifications as read
- **User-Specific**: Ensured that notifications are user-specific with row-level security

### 8. Database Maintenance

We've added database maintenance functions to keep the database running smoothly:

- **Vacuum**: Added a function to vacuum the database to reclaim space and update statistics
- **Analyze**: Added a function to analyze the database to update statistics
- **Statistics**: Added functions to get database and index statistics

## Benefits

These performance optimizations provide several benefits:

1. **Improved Query Performance**: Indexes and materialized views improve query performance
2. **Reduced Data Transfer**: Database functions reduce the amount of data transferred between the application and the database
3. **Improved Search Relevance**: Full-text search improves search relevance
4. **Location-Based Features**: Geospatial queries enable location-based features
5. **Real-Time Updates**: Real-time notifications keep users informed of order status changes
6. **Maintainability**: Database functions and triggers encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to maintain

## Usage Examples

### Full-Text Search

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_products_full_text(
    'organic apple',
    category_id => '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
    min_price => 1.0,
    max_price => 10.0,
    in_stock_only => TRUE,
    on_sale_only => FALSE,
    sort_by => 'relevance',
    page_number => 1,
    page_size => 20
);
```

### Geospatial Queries

```sql
SELECT * FROM find_addresses_within_radius(
    lat => 37.7749,
    lng => -122.4194,
    radius_meters => 5000,
    user_id_param => '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
);
```

### Real-Time Notifications

```sql
SELECT * FROM create_notification(
    user_id_param => '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
    title_param => 'Order Status Update',
    message_param => 'Your order #12345 is now shipped',
    type_param => 'order_status',
    data_param => '{"order_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000", "status": "shipped"}'
);
```

## Conclusion

The performance optimizations implemented for the Dayliz App database provide a solid foundation for the clean architecture implementation. By improving query performance, enabling advanced search capabilities, and adding real-time features, we've ensured that the database can support the needs of the application now and in the future.
