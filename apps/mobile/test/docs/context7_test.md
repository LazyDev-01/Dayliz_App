# Context7 MCP Server Integration Test

This document describes testing procedures for Context7 MCP server integration.

## Test Code Completion

Try typing a partial Flutter widget below and see if Context7 provides intelligent completions:

Example: `Sta` should suggest `StatelessWidget`, `StatefulWidget`, etc.

## Test Code Explanation

Ask Context7 to explain this Flutter code:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Text('Hello, Context7!'),
    );
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior

Context7 should be able to:
1. Provide intelligent code completions for Flutter widgets
2. Explain Flutter code structure and patterns
3. Suggest improvements and best practices
4. Help with debugging and error resolution

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Code completion works for Flutter widgets
- [ ] Code explanation provides accurate information
- [ ] Suggestions are relevant to Flutter/Dart context
- [ ] Integration doesn't interfere with normal development workflow
