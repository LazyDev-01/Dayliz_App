# 🔍 Debug Menu Verification Guide

## **🎯 Quick Check**

### **Step 1: Verify Debug Menu is Updated**
1. Open your Dayliz app
2. Go to **Profile** tab
3. Scroll down and tap **"Debug Menu"**
4. **Look for this at the top**:

```
🚀 DEBUG MENU UPDATED!
If you can see this, the debug menu is working. Auth screens below!
```

### **Step 2: If You See the Update**
Great! The debug menu is working. You should now see:

```
🔐 Authentication Testing
├── Premium Auth Landing Screen
├── Phone Authentication Flow  
└── OTP Verification Screen
```

### **Step 3: If You DON'T See the Update**
The app needs to be restarted:
1. **Stop the app completely** (don't just minimize)
2. **Restart from your IDE** or device
3. **Navigate back** to Profile → Debug Menu

## **🚀 Testing the Auth Screens**

### **Option 1: Premium Auth Landing Screen**
- **What it tests**: Main authentication entry point
- **Features**: Animated background, 3 auth buttons, guest mode
- **Expected**: Beautiful gradient background with floating elements

### **Option 2: Phone Authentication Flow**
- **What it tests**: Phone number input screen
- **Features**: International phone input, country codes, validation
- **Expected**: Modern phone input with country selection

### **Option 3: OTP Verification Screen**
- **What it tests**: 6-digit PIN input
- **Features**: Auto-focus, resend timer, animations
- **Expected**: Professional OTP input screen

## **🐛 Troubleshooting**

### **If Auth Screens Show Errors**
This means the dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
flutter pub get
flutter clean
# Then restart the app
```

### **If Debug Menu Doesn't Update**
1. **Force close** the app completely
2. **Clear app cache** if possible
3. **Restart** the app
4. **Navigate** to Profile → Debug Menu

### **If Compilation Errors**
The new dependencies (`intl_phone_field`, `pin_code_fields`) need to be installed:
1. Run `flutter pub get`
2. Restart the app completely
3. The errors should disappear
