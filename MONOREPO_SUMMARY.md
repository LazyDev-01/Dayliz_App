## 📋 Quick Overview

### 🚨 Current Problem
- **Confusing Structure**: `Dayliz_App` folder name doesn't indicate it's the frontend
- **Team Confusion**: Frontend developers won't know where to find the mobile app
- **Redundant Files**: Multiple `pubspec.yaml`, `.metadata`, and config files
- **Poor Scalability**: Current structure can't support planned 5 applications
- **No Clear Boundaries**: Difficult to assign ownership to team members

### ✅ Proposed Solution: Monorepo with Apps/Services Structure
