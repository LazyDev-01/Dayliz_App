4. Choose Google Pay
5. Complete payment with test UPI ID
6. Verify success screen and order creation
7. Check backend logs for payment verification
```

**Scenario 2: Payment Failure Handling**
```
1. Add items to cart
2. Navigate to payment selection
3. Select UPI payment method
4. Initiate payment but cancel in UPI app
5. Verify failure handling and error messages
6. Test retry payment functionality
```

**Scenario 3: Network Error Scenarios**
```
1. Disable network during order creation

```
1. Test minimum amount (₹1.00)
2. Test maximum amount limits
3. Test negative amounts
4. Test decimal precision
5. Test currency validation (only INR)
```

#### **Authentication Security**
```
1. Test expired JWT tokens
2. Test invalid authentication headers
3. Test concurrent payment attempts
4. Test payment with different user tokens
```

#### **Signature Verification**
```
1. Test valid Razorpay signatures
2. Test invalid/tampered signatures
3. Test signature timing attacks
4. Test webhook signature validation
```

### **3. Performance Testing**

#### **Load Testing**
```
1. Concurrent payment requests (10+ users)
2. Payment processing under load
3. Database performance with multiple orders
4. API response times under stress
```

#### **Mobile Performance**
```
1. Payment flow on low-end devices
2. Memory usage during payment processing
3. Battery impact of payment operations
4. Network usage optimization
```

## 🔍 **Test Data & Environment Setup**

### **Test Razorpay Configuration**
```env
# Test Mode Keys (Safe for testing)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=test_secret_key_xxxxxxxxxx

# Test UPI IDs
TEST_UPI_SUCCESS=success@razorpay
TEST_UPI_FAILURE=failure@razorpay
```

### **Test User Accounts**
```
Test User 1: test1@dayliz.com (Successful payments)
Test User 2: test2@dayliz.com (Failed payments)
Test User 3: test3@dayliz.com (Network issues)
```

### **Test Cart Scenarios**
```
Small Order: ₹50 (Below free delivery)
Medium Order: ₹300 (With delivery fee)
Large Order: ₹1200 (Free delivery)
Edge Case: ₹999 (Delivery threshold)
```
